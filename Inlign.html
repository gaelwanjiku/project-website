				 If you want to use RAND to generate a random
				number but don't want the numbers to change every 
				time the cell is calculated, you can enter =RAND() 
				in the formula bar, and then press F9 to change the 
				formula to a random number. The formula will 
				calculate and leave you with just a value.

			<p>
				AND returns an evenly distributed random real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. A new random real number is returned every time the worksheet is calculated.
   
				Note: As of Excel 2010, Excel uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm (MT19937) to generate random numbers. 
   
				Syntax
				RAND()
   
				The RAND function syntax has no arguments.
   
				Remarks
				To generate a random real number between a and b, use:
   
				=RAND()*(b-a)
